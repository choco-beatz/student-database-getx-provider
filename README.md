### Description

The **Student Database App** is a simple Flutter application that allows users to manage student data locally. With features for adding, editing, deleting, and searching student records, this app can be used as a learning tool for understanding state management and local data persistence in Flutter. 

The app uses **SQFlite** for local database storage and is developed using two different state management techniques: **GetX** and **Provider**, available in separate branches.

### Features

- **Add Student**: Add new student records with details such as name, age, and class.
- **Edit Student**: Update the details of existing student records.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records from the database.
- **View Student**: Display a list of all students.
- **Search Student**: Search for specific students by name.

### Screenshots

(Add screenshots showing the different features like adding, editing, viewing, and searching students.)

### Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The main framework for app development.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.
- **SQFlite**: For local database storage.
- **GetX**: For state management in the `getx` branch.
- **Provider**: For state management in the `provider` branch.

### State Management (Branches)

This project demonstrates two different state management approaches:
- **GetX Branch**: The `getx` branch contains a complete implementation of the app using **GetX** for state management.
- **Provider Branch**: The `provider` branch implements the same app using **Provider** for state management.

To switch between these branches:
1. **GetX**:
   ```bash
   git checkout getx
   ```
2. **Provider**:
   ```bash
   git checkout provider
   ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-database-app.git
   cd student-database-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Usage
